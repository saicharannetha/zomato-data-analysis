# 🍽️ Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis




## 🎯 Project Objectives
The primary aim was to transform raw data into business intelligence using effective data modeling, time-series tracking, and service pattern discovery. Specific goals included:

Creating foundational tables like a calendar table and country mapping table to support dynamic filtering.

Analyzing restaurant growth across different time dimensions (year, quarter, month).

Segmenting data based on ratings, pricing, cuisine types, and service availability (e.g., online delivery, table booking).

Enhancing decision-making with visuals showing the geographical spread and service models of restaurants.
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
SQL: Used to perform initial data exploration, joins, aggregations, and conditional logic to answer real-world queries.

Power BI: Built an interactive dashboard with slicers, cards, charts, and maps to present insights in a business-friendly manner.
